<MainWidget>:
    perspective_point_x: self.width/2
    perspective_point_y: self. height * 0.75        # 1

# 1
# Because we've created perspective_point_x and perspective_point_y attributes inside of the python file, we
# can use these custom attributes inside of the .kv file

# 2
# How is it possible that putting on our custom attributes of "perspective_point_" for x and y in the kivy
# file automatically update?
    # It's because these attributes are binding, meaning that whatever changes are made to attributes,
    # it will automatically update the attribute with the new data.
