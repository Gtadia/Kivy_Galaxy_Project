# This is how you import other files ("#:")

# In order to show the image in the background, we are going to create a canvas BEFORE anything else so that it's in the background.
# Then we are going to make a rectangle that fills up the entire window.
# Then we are going to have the rectangle display the image.

# We are using the MainWidget class/widget within the "menu.kv" file

# 4
# We are using an ID to access it within the main.py file so that we can change its opacity

# 5
# We are displaying the score
# (This goes after the menu so that it is displayed on top of the menu so that we can see it after the game is over/before the game starts)
